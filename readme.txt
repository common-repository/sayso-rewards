Monetize your website with our free survey offerwall. Your visitors give opinions and earn gift cards, you generate revenue and we donate to charity!

== Description ==

The SaySo Rewards plugin gives you the ability to monetize your website or blog by giving your visitors the opportunity to participate in online, anonymous market research surveys and tasks in exchange for points redeemable for gift cards.

Simply install the plugin and inform your site's visitors of this new opportunity and we will take care of the rest. We source the survey opportunities from our network of market researchers and match your visitors with the surveys most relevant to them. 

Each time one of your visitors completes an opportunity, points will accumulate in their account balance which they will be able to redeem for a variety of gift cards. In addition, we pay YOU for each completed opportunity AND we always donate to charity with every complete. Win-win-win

FOR GOOD: With every completed survey, we make a donation to our charitable partner Action Against Hunger as part of our on-going mission to end childhood death from hunger and malnutrition. You make money, your visitors make money and the world is made a better place!
